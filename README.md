## Overview

AWGS is an advanced project management support system that generates optimal WBS through context-adaptive interviews and intelligent analysis. It dynamically adjusts to project scale, complexity, and methodology without requiring external dependencies.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Project Classification**: Scale and complexity-based optimization
- **Context-Adaptive Interviews**: Intelligent question generation and flow
- **Multi-Layer Risk Management**: Comprehensive risk analysis and response
- **Dynamic Integration Management**: Real-time dependency handling
- **Stakeholder Matrix Management**: Role-based communication optimization
- **Intelligent WBS Generation**: Methodology-based structure customization

## Core Components

The system consists of five main components:

1. **Project Classification Engine**
   - Scale assessment
   - Complexity evaluation
   - Methodology matching

2. **Interview Framework**
   - Context-adaptive questioning
   - Dynamic depth adjustment
   - Response optimization

3. **Risk Management System**
   - Multi-layer risk analysis
   - Dynamic response generation
   - Impact assessment

4. **Integration Management**
   - Dependency tracking
   - Resource optimization
   - Schedule coordination

5. **WBS Generation Engine**
   - Structure customization
   - Pattern optimization
   - Quality control

## Application Areas

The system can be applied to:

- Project Planning
- Risk Management
- Resource Allocation
- Schedule Management
- Quality Control
- Stakeholder Management
- Change Management
- Program Integration
